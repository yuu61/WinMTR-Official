# WinMTR-Official

Thank you for downloading WinMTR v0.92!

## About

WinMTR is a free Microsoft Windows visual application that combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping in a single network diagnostic tool. WinMTR is Open Source Software, (barely) maintained by Dragos Manac.

It was started in 2000 by Vasile Laurentiu Stanimir as a clone for the popular Matt's Traceroute (hence MTR) Linux/UNIX utility.

## License & Redistribution

WinMTR is offered as Open Source Software under GPL v2.

## Installation

You will get a `.zip` archive containing two folders: `WinMTR-32` and `WinMTR-64`. Both contain two files: `WinMTR.exe` and `README.md`.

Just extract the `WinMTR.exe` for your platform (32 or 64 bit) and click to run it. If you don't know what version you need, just click on both files and see which one works ;-)

As you can see, WinMTR requires no other installation effort.

**Tip:** You can copy `WinMTR.exe` to `Windows/System32` so it's accessible via the command line (cmd).

## Usage

### Visual

1. Start WinMTR
2. Write the name or IP of the host (e.g. `github.com`)
3. Press the **Options** button to configure ping size, maximum hops and ping interval (the defaults are OK)
4. Push the **Start** button and wait
5. Copy or export the results in text or HTML format — useful if you want to document or file a complaint with your ISP
6. Click on **Clear History** to remove the hosts you have previously traced

### Command Line
```
winmtr --help        # See available options
winmtr github.com    # Trace a host
```

## Troubleshooting

**I type in the address and nothing happens.**
Usually this has to do with antivirus or firewall applications. Disable them when debugging or using WinMTR, or configure them properly.

**I get an error saying the program cannot be executed.**
You are running the 64-bit version on a 32-bit platform. Try the `WinMTR.exe` in the `WinMTR_x32` folder.

**I get an error not listed here.**
Please report it to us to make sure it's not a bug in the application.
